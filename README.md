## About Deep Mob Learning Extended


A server friendly mod for mob loot acquisition. Inspired by Soul shards where you could "collect" mob kills to later
reuse them for mob spawners.

This mod however uses "Data models" that you train by defeating monsters both by hand or by
simulation(In the simulation chamber). 

To get started you will need a Deep Learner, which will house the data models, and
some type of mob data model.

Once your data models have reached higher tiers you can use them in the simulation chamber to get loot.

## DMLE's Intentions

The intentions of this forked project is to study and expand the mod in it's 1.12.2 state to further the experience and push the project to it's limits.
Being branched off of a pre-modifed form of DML called [Deep Mob Learning "Grindfest Edition"](https://github.com/Ethryan/DeepMobLearning) modified by 
[Ethryan](https://github.com/Ethryan).
I have been taking the time to build off that and further experiment with adding more features into the project!


## Project / Feature Tracker

You can find the planed features and changes over on the [DMLE Tracker](https://github.com/X-Niter/DeepMobLearning-1.12-Extended/projects/1).
